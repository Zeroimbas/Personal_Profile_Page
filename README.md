# Personal_ProfilePage
This is the page I programmed for practice my html,css and js skills.

The idea of creating this page is to use as a profile for my personal resume as well as a proof of myself learning in the process of html,css and js.

Friday Dec 6 2019 Update:
  Finished background, nav bar and clock, the and circular animation behind the clock.
  Next goal, creating link to my personal resume for the 'resume' hyper link in the nav bar.
